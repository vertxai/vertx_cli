# Introduction
This repository contains releases for Vertx command-line tool (`vertx_cli`). 
Please, find detailed documentation at [https://www.vertx.ai/docs](https://www.vertx.ai/docs).

Vertx provides solutions for **content-based multimedia search** (query by example) in large-scale multimedia databases
containing millions of items. It's very much like "Shazam" but extended to work with videos.
It has the ability to operate on severely distorted media content
(for example, camera jitter, screen with glare, acoustic noise) and can robustly identify content from multimedia clips.

### What can Vertx do for you:
- **_Copyright protection:_** scan video and audio content against a database of copyrighted music, movies, and TV shows;
  find instantly any matching items in user uploaded clips.
- **_Duplicate detection:_** scan your multimedia catalogue and detect duplicate content.
- **_Detection of copyrighted and duplicate content in live streams:_** scan live streams and detect matches in real-time.
- **_Identify music and movies on mobile devices:_** point cellphone camera at a TV screen and get the titles of the movie and the song being played.
- **_Live broadcast monitoring:_** scan live multimedia streams and find matches with broadcast TV or radio channels.
- **_On-device content identification:_** identify audio and video content on a mobile device with no internet connection.
